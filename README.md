# The Challenge:
"The challenge is to integrate NASA data, ground-based air quality data, and citizen science data to create an air quality surface that displays the most accurate data for a location and time. Create algorithms that select or weight the  best data from several sources for a specific time and location, and display that information" [*1]

# Hawa
Hawa is one of the NASA challenges for 2019. It is an algorithm that integrates the most accurate data that indicates more efficiency about the Air quality for a specific location and time:



# Quesitions to answer: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. [As long as we deal with an existed data? who is the resource of the input data? Who is going to benefit from our output?]
>>>


2.[ Why air quality? Why the world care about the air quality? what is the core value of this algorithm?]
>>>---------------------
"Air pollution is associated with almost 5 million annual deaths worldwide as well as harm to countless others through negative health impacts from asthma and diabetes to cardiovascular disease an cancer. The World Bank estimates that air pollutio cosets the global economy $225 billion in lost labor income and $5 trillion in welfare losses annually" [*2] [**]



3. [Those who will use Hawa algorithm, what are the addressed problem in real world that they want to solve using Hawa Algorithm?]
>>>



4. [How is Hawa algorithm going to be different form the existed methodologies> Can we address what companies, organizations, or existed industries and agencies that have a strong technology that similar or better than Hawa algorithm in any way? ]
*note: this question indicates the energy and passion that push us to keep Hawa uniqueness, success, cooperation, and partnership     
>>>



5. [From a scientific stand point, what are the main factors that the air quality relying on?]
>>>
