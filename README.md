# Hawa
Hawa is one of the NASA challenges for 2019. It is an algorithm that integrates the most accurate data that indicates more efficiency about the Air quality for a specfic loactiona and time. 



# Quesiitions to answer:
1. As long as we deal with an existed data? who is the resource of the inout data? Who is going to benifit from our output?
>>>


2. Why air quality? Why the world care about the air quality? with is the core value of this algorithm?
>>>



3. Those who will use Hawa algorithm, what are the addressed problem in real world that they want to solve using Hawa Algorithm?
>>>



4. How is Hawa algorithm going to be different form the existed methdologies> Can we address what companies, organizations, or existed industries and agencies that have a strong technology that smailar or better than Hawa algorithm in any way? 
*note: this question indicates the energy and passion that push us tp keep Hawa uniqueness, success, cooperation, and partnership
